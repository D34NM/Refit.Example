# Refit.Example
Simple project demonstrating usage of Refit and Polly. 

This example shows on how to use a simple retry policy from Polly, together with Refit. 

The client is there just to make it more simpler to add new examples and abstract the contracts from the API. It was not idea to make the
"perfect" solution anyway :)
